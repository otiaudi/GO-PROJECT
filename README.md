# 🚀 My Golang Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal Go (Golang) learning repository! 👋

This repository is where I document my journey of learning the Go programming language from scratch. It includes my practice code, notes, and mini-projects as I build my skills in a hands-on way. The goal is to strengthen my understanding of Go by working through examples, solving problems, and writing useful programs.

## 📚 About Go

**Go**, also known as **Golang**, is an open-source programming language created by Google. It is known for being fast, simple, and reliable. Go is especially good for building web servers, APIs, cloud services, and concurrent programs.

---

## 🎯 My Learning Goals

- Understand Go syntax and structure
- Learn to use variables, control flow, and data types
- Practice writing functions and using structs
- Explore interfaces and error handling
- Learn how to write concurrent code with goroutines and channels
- Build small real-world Go projects
- Document everything I learn along the way

## 🛠️ Tools and Setup

- **Go Version:** 1.21 (or your installed version)
- **Code Editor:** [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## ▶️ How to Run Code

-To run any `.go` file from the terminal, use the following command:

```bash
go run filename.go

cd basics
go run hello_world.go

 ##Current Topics I'm Working On
 - Print statements and comments

 - Variables, constants, and data types

 - Control flow: if, for, switch

 - Functions and error handling

 - Structs and interfaces

 - File I/O

 - Concurrency with goroutines


 ## ✍️ Notes to Myself
This repo is meant to help me grow as a Go developer. It may include:

Unfinished or rough code as I learn

Comments and explanations to future me

Mistakes (that I’ll learn from!)

Step-by-step improvements over time
